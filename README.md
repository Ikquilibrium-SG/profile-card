## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I started by creating the HTML structure for the profile card component by placing all the required details in a container. Then proceeded to css file. Following the design image, I used the background property like the background image, repeat and position property both in the body. 


```css
body {
    background-image: url("images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
    background-position: right 700px bottom 100px, left 660px top 300px;
}

header {
    background: url("images/bg-pattern-card.svg") no-repeat;
    background-size: 320px;
}
```
